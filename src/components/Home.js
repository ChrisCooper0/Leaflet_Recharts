          <strong>Note:</strong> I chose to learn and implement D3.js over
          TypeScript for this app in the interest of time. I have added notes on
          each page of stretch goals I will continue to work on after the
          submission date. Refactoring to TypeScript and enhancing the data
          analysis capabilities (e.g. Adding react-table) are two of them.
